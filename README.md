## Overview

This project involves the analysis of passenger satisfaction within the airline industry. We have gathered data from various passenger profiles, including flight distance, travel purpose, chosen flight class, and customer type (returning or new). Passengers rate different services on a scale from 1 to 5, and we aim to uncover insights and areas for improvement based on this analysis.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning**: We started by cleaning the data to handle missing values and irregularities.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: We conducted a descriptive analysis of services rated by passengers.
3. **Segmentation**: Passengers were categorized into groups based on age, flight distance, and flight delays.
4. **Frequent Passenger Profile**: We identified key characteristics of frequent passengers.
5. **Percentage of Satisfied Passengers**: We calculated the overall satisfaction percentage and explored variations among categories.
6. **Areas for Improvement**: We focused on areas that could enhance airline revenue by targeting specific customer groups.
7. **Factors Contributing to Satisfaction**: Regression analysis helped identify factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

## Findings

- Business class passengers have higher satisfaction rates compared to economy class passengers.
- Business travelers exhibit higher satisfaction, with 95% of them opting for business class.
- Younger passengers tend to rate services more evenly compared to other age groups.
- Returning customers are generally more satisfied than new customers.

## Areas for Improvement

### Business Class Customers

**Services Before the Flight:**
1. Improve ease of airline ticket acquisition.
2. Enhance airport gate location information.

**Services During or After the Flight:**
1. Evaluate and adjust boarding and landing times.
2. Enhance the quality and availability of in-flight Wi-Fi service.

### Economy Class Customers

**Services Before the Flight:**
1. Facilitate and promote online check-in services.
2. Improve the ease of airline ticket acquisition.
3. Enhance airport gate location information.

**Services During or After the Flight:**
1. Enhance the quality and availability of in-flight Wi-Fi service.

## Factors Contributing to Satisfaction

The top five factors influencing passenger satisfaction are:
1. Online boarding service (airline ticket purchase or reservation modifications online).
2. In-flight entertainment services (movies, music, series, etc.).
3. Seat comfort.
4. In-flight Wi-Fi service.
5. In-flight attendant service.

## Conclusion

This analysis suggests that by improving specific services like online ticket purchase, seat comfort, and in-flight Wi-Fi, airlines can increase passenger satisfaction and potentially boost revenue. It's important to consider the cost-benefit analysis of these improvements.
